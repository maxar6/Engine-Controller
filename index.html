                            <h3>Presentation and Justification of the Problem</h3>
							<br></br>
							<p>Each year crop yields are significantly affected by disease and insects. But, much of this loss of yield does not come directly from the diseases and insects, much of it comes from the inefficient methods that we use to detect and remove such ailments. Even in the most modern farms, a large portion of crops each year (12-24%) are crushed, or otherwise destroyed in early to mid-season by pesticide and herbicide sprays. This destruction is due to non-targeted spraying that, because of blanket coverage, has the tractor and the implement drive over much of the field wasting many chemicals, and destroying otherwise viable crops. Due to this non-targeted spraying, often times, the parts of the fields that are infected, are not covered properly to the extent that the spray doesn’t solve the problem.</p>

							<br></br>
							<p>The purpose of Element B, was to analyze prior attempts to solve a similar problem. The reason that the problems were similar, rather than previous products, is because this type of idea has never been done before. Within the element, we attempted to find products which contained elements that we could use to help develop our own improved product. While these drones are successful in their own manner, they do not fulfill the purposes intended, or are not successful in completing the task that we are trying to throw at it.</p>

							<h3>Current program uses in agriculture</h3>
							<ul>
							<div align="left">
								<li>Hyperspectral remote sensing use is increasing for monitoring the development and health of crops</li>

								<li>Used to detect the nutrient and water status of wheat in irrigated systems</li>
								<li>An entire spectrum is acquired at each point</li>
								<li>The operator needs no prior knowledge of the sample</li>
								<li>Post-processing allows all available information from the dataset to be mined</li>
								<li>Utilizes the spatial relationships among the various spectra in a neighbourhood, thus allowing more elaborate spectral-spatial models for a more accurate segmentation and classification of the image.</li>

							<h3>Presentation and Justification of Solution Design Requirements</h3>
							<br></br>
                            <p>The focus of element C was to determine the criteria that our final product will need to consist of, and the importance of each item of criteria. Each item of criteria will have a value as to how important it is in the final product, and each will be defined and explained.</p>

							<p><i>“A simple beginner's model can cost less than $100, with camera drones starting at a few hundred dollars. More complex drones, starting at less than $1,000, offer customizable and programmable features, turning them into truly autonomous devices that can make their own decisions.”</i></p>

							<h3>Maintenance</h3>
							<p>The final product will be easy to maintain, it will require only minor adjustments and changes, as the field of agriculture changes. It will require yearly maintenance checks to keep it functioning properly. These types of services must also be able to be provided by either a average local mechanic or buy an inexpensive national based service this is in a direct contrast to most current drones which on top of being extraordinarily expensive have extraordinarily hard to repair systems and systems that make it said an average technician or mechanic cannot work on these systems this increases the overall cost for the user as well as making them less friendly for those who wish to operate them.</p>

							<h3>Ease of Operation</h3>
							<p>The final product will be easy enough for a customer with little to no background knowledge to operate. The product will be mostly autonomous, requiring little to no configuration. Due to the extraordinarily complicated system which are currently and used it is often unviable without training to fly one of these things in fact in doing research we found that about 70% of these drones services have mandatory to day to one week long training courses on how simply to flatten safely this is an accessible to the average farmer who can take time out of their busy schedules especially during planting and harvesting season to attempt to take this course is this system must be easy enough to utilize that the average farmer or even average worker can utilize it without training and without extraordinarily complication obviously there's cannot be done easily but it simply has to be an intuitive enough system having an operating system based much like a video game flight control system or like a smartphone control tablet when they make them far far easier to use.</p>

							<h3>Reliability</h3>
							<p>The program will be able to properly identify certain diseases in corn crops, and give correct coordinates of the affected area. The program will also be able to be run throughout the entire growing season. Despite the system's necessity of easy repair, what is even more important, is as the system leave found is that it simply doesn't sale in the first place this is must operate everytime exact same way in the exact same manner it is meant to failures especially during specially in a farmer's world in peak season make it so it is almost impossible to have the time to go get her repair even fair repair is simple to do and local.</p>

							<h3>Safety</h3>
							<p>The final product will not blow up or cause any kind of damage to people, equipment, crops, or other farm inhabitants. Will require no maintenance that could be harmful to anyone. The problem with many current systems is as safe as stated above there on easy to use by making it easier to use TV also make them safe see you these two are tied closely to make it truly safe all one has to do is make sure it's easy to use that it is slower chance of harming someone as well as having several failsafe such as range detectors a pseudo autonomous system and more than likely a failsafe button on anything that would be piloting it to make sure it operates in the proper fashion.</p>

							</table>
							<br></br>
							
							<h3>Legality</h3>
							<p>The final product will stay within the legal constraints of drones, quad-copters, and agriculture. Seeing as in most states one needs an operator's aviation license and flying regulations by the FAA it is difficult to get this so therefore to make it legal a business which complies with the regulations  the National Farmers Association to comply with things such as Farm Bureau, The Future Farmers of America, and the Dairy Farmers Association to make sure that it is inline with their contract as well as allowing for mass sale. Due to the complications involving getting private lessons to make it legal. More than likely it would make sense to simply sell them to a company who would then be hired to do these things by having this company provide the pilots as well as technology. To even reduce the cost on farmers more significantly and make it far easier for this to be legal and have it be accessible to all farmers the company would acquire a national drone license.</p>
							<p><i>“Drones, like other aircraft, are regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA has taken the position that it is illegal to fly nearly all commercial drones. In recent publications, the FAA has contended that commercial operations are only authorized on a case-by-case basis.”</i></p>

							<h3>Durability</h3>
							<p>Final product must be tough and sturdy enough to be transported and stay in functioning condition after receiving minor falls/crashes. As stated above when it crashed into a person many of the previous models did crash and break. We can't have this happening because in industrial settings it's not uncommon for things to have collisions or to be used quite roughly due to this even need to have strong locking and bolting mechanisms as well as simply have well made parts, preferably American.</p>

							<br></br>
                            <p>The purpose of element D is to help give you the first true ideas of our final design. The reason this is needed is because within our group is that each of the four members created 3 different and unique drones based off of different principles. What this means is at this time it looks like we have 12 different options. Clearly that is not viable therefore we must either narrow it down to a single option or must drive a solid option from it. Furthermore if one is attempting to create an effective drone a single persons ideas generally will not be enough what is advisable is to choose multiple people's ideas and combine them into a more efficient one.</p>

                            <h3>Application of STEM Principle and Practices</h3>
                            <p>The purpose of element E is to apply the principles that we have learned through some research the CEMS program and through Project Lead the Way classes starting in principles of engineering. To do this we have to focus on the evidence and the functionality of our device and the forces on it these will need to be reviewed by multiple experts as well as several other classmates.</p>
                            <br></br>
							<p>Seeing as it is a drone the first thing that we will have to focus on is the weight requirement this is the requirements for the drone to lift, this will have to include not only the camera and the drone itself but also things such as GPS and radio and getting equipment that we can utilize the drill. Secondly we will need to account for the rotational and wind velocities affecting the drone to assure that we have at the very least a semi stable drone, this will be to the camera does not have so much lateral motion that I cannot take smooth video. And not only just within the entirety of the drone will have to look at this will have to look within the drawing itself at things such as the scoring points of the joints as well as mechanical bonding but also within the materials choices itself to minimize the weights for maximizing the strength as you have to do with drugs. Hopefully the cumulative effect of this work will be a clear stable well focused on green image that is usable to put the processing software we are developing to be able to analyze the video so that it can be used for both the farmers and for ourselves.</p>

                            <h3>Consideration of Design Viability</h3>
							<br></br>
                            <p>The various factors that were necessary to discuss in determining the viability of designs and which design we should go with involves things such as speed, stability, ability to modify and of course all that were listed in element B. The first one of these that we had to choose and make a decision based on was how easy it was for us to complete, seeing as we did not have much funds or time we had to go with a design that would be simplistic to complete with the resources that we had available. This meant that two of the designs put forward by Calvin Benson were eliminated because of their high cost and time involved in fixed-wing aircraft as well as in a hexacopter. Second we had to eliminate two designs as proposed by Mason due to their inability to have reasonable speeds while still maintaining the list that was necessary.</p>
							<p>So first we assess the viability of each of the 12 designs. We will describe to you the means of which we were able to make our process of success and elimination.</p>
							<p>First Alex pribula her first design also known as design four was eliminated due to it not having any proper functions that were necessary while it would work well as a civilian personal drone it lacked virtually any and all liability for agricultural purpose. Her second drone also known as design 5 was much closer to what we were looking for and due to its comparatively high scores in its ease of operations as well as in the business side of it, it was determined that this model of drone which was very similar to one presented by all the other members. This would be the basis of what we'd go off of. Our third design was thrown out of the competition for not being viable due to budgetary constraints.</p>
							<p>Next we assess the drones of Calvin Benson his first drone was not successful due to its low scores in its reliability as well as safety and ease of use, this was determined that it would not be suitable for business and therefore must be eliminated. His second drone design scored much higher in business aspects but lacked the key component of being able to provide enough lift within budget to be viable for long-term flights. The third drone Which had been presented scored very well in the legal and transport side of it but so poorly and maintenance and upkeep that would be considered not viable for the average farmer.</p>
							<p>Third we discussed the drones of Mason Brejnik his first drone was thrown out due to the fact that though it was extremely safe it would not be easy to make it safe and usable. The second drone was slightly better across the board by having it be slightly safer and slightly more usable but still locked in the budgetary and Effectiveness categories therefore it had to be thrown out. Third and final drone which he designed was one of the best, focusing in on the business side of it while still maintaining the usability side for the farmers. Why we did not overall go with this drone, it had one of the more heavily influencing parts of the final product but not all of it.</p>
							<p>Finally we consider the drones of Fischer Johnson which focused most commonly on the effectiveness. His first drone was extremely effective, way over budget and therefore could not be used. The second drone was within budget but lacked any and all safety as well as was not considered durable or reusable therefore it had to be thrown out. The third and final drone was considered very precise as well as legal but once again ran into budgetary constraints and therefore cannot be used.</p>
							<p>So overall we began work off of the secondary design by Alex. While her design was the basis of the Drone all other drones did have quite heavy influence in it, Mason Brejnik drones were heavily influential within how to stabilize it have to get a good solid camera resolution while still moving at proper speeds. Fischer Johnson’s drones were used as inspiration for the electronics and for the control systems that made it so it was easy to use for the farmers what are removing many of the aspects that would put it over budget. Calvin Benson ideas were fully used within the stability and the business and legal side of it making sure that a business could use it legally without too much government interference through licensing, marketing, and the structure and the sizing of the Drone which were to be used.</p>

                            <h3>Prototype Testing and Data Collection Plan</h3>
							<br></br>
                            <p>The premise of element H is to begin planning how testing will work once the drone is completed. At this time the drone is not completed but this plan is being developed for the purpose of successfully being able to complete tests upon finishing the drones construction. The drone will be run through a series of tests; testing various things such as speed, stability, camera resolution, the ability to discern the colors and patterns, possible weight requirements.</p>
							<p>The first test that will be completed will be the main stability test for this test we will place the drone on both covered and smooth surfaces to test take offs and landings. The drone will also need to be tested for in flight turbulence.</p>
							<p>A test will also be done to find the optimal settings for the speed and camera speed, to get the clearest resolution in the pictures, to make the coding as accurate as possible.</p>
							<p>The next test will be a flight speed test, this will be the most simple test seeing as it is simply taking the drone up to a height of 22 feet and flying out at maximum velocity. We will also need to test the drone to see what speed is the optimal speed for taking the clearest pictures for analysis.</p>
							<p>What would follow that would be the video resolution test this will be done through taking the drone up to viewing height at approximately 20 feet bring it over a field of objects and different colors and shapes and then seeing at which speeds the drones are stable enough to record accurate data.</p>
							<p>Once we have tested to drone for these key features we will have to test the function of the coding. Meaning we will have to make sure our code can decipher between certain colors and patterns as well as relaying the most accurate GPS coordinates as possible.</p>
							<p>A very obvious restraint would be Drone weight. This could become a problem, but we have purchased motors and power supply that are far more powerful than is necessary so we have determined that it is only necessary to do a single takeoff test to guarantee  that it work acceptably</p>
