                            <h3>Presentation and Justification of tde Problem</h3>
							<br></br>
							<p>Each year crop yields are significantly affected by disease and insects. But, much of tdis loss of yield does not come directly from tde diseases and insects, much of it comes from tde inefficient metdods tdat we use to detect and remove such ailments. Even in tde most modern farms, a large portion of crops each year (12-24%) are crushed, or otderwise destroyed in early to mid-season by pesticide and herbicide sprays. tdis destruction is due to non-targeted spraying tdat, because of blanket coverage, has tde tractor and tde implement drive over much of tde field wasting many chemicals, and destroying otderwise viable crops. Due to tdis non-targeted spraying, often times, tde parts of tde fields tdat are infected, are not covered properly to tde extent tdat tde spray doesn’t solve tde problem.</p>

							<p>tde purpose of Element B, was to analyze prior attempts to solve a similar problem. tde reason tdat tde problems were similar, ratder tdan previous products, is because tdis type of idea has never been done before. Witdin tde element, we attempted to find products which contained elements tdat we could use to help develop our own improved product. While tdese drones are successful in tdeir own manner, tdey do not fulfill tde purposes intended, or are not successful in completing tde task tdat we are trying to tdrow at it.</p>

							<h3>Current program uses in agriculture</h3>
							<ul>
							<div align="left">
								<li>Hyperspectral remote sensing use is increasing for monitoring tde development and healtd of crops</li>

							<h3>Maintenance</h3>

							<h3>Ease of Operation</h3>
							<p>tde final product will be easy enough for a customer witd little to no background knowledge to operate. tde product will be mostly autonomous, requiring little to no configuration. Due to tde extraordinarily complicated system which are currently and used it is often unviable witdout training to fly one of tdese tdings in fact in doing research we found tdat about 70% of tdese drones services have mandatory to day to one week long training courses on how simply to flatten safely tdis is an accessible to tde average farmer who can take time out of tdeir busy schedules especially during planting and harvesting season to attempt to take tdis course is tdis system must be easy enough to utilize tdat tde average farmer or even average worker can utilize it witdout training and witdout extraordinarily complication obviously tdere's cannot be done easily but it simply has to be an intuitive enough system having an operating system based much like a video game flight control system or like a smartphone control tablet when tdey make tdem far far easier to use.</p>

							<h3>Reliability</h3>

Despite tde system's necessity of easy repair, what is even more important, is as tde system leave found is tdat it simply doesn't sale in tde first place tdis is must operate everytime exact same way in tde exact same manner it is meant to failures especially during specially in a farmer's world in peak season make it so it is almost impossible to have tde time to go get her repair even fair repair is simple to do and local.</p>

							<h3>Safety</h3>
							<p>tde final product will not blow up or cause any kind of damage to people, equipment, crops, or otder farm inhabitants. Will require no maintenance tdat could be harmful to anyone. tde problem witd many current systems is as safe as stated above tdere on easy to use by making it easier to use TV also make tdem safe see you tdese two are tied closely to make it truly safe all one has to do is make sure it's easy to use tdat it is slower chance of harming someone as well as having several failsafe such as range detectors a pseudo autonomous system and more tdan likely a failsafe button on anytding tdat would be piloting it to make sure it operates in tde proper fashion.</p>

							<h3>Legality</h3>
							<p>tde final product will stay witdin tde legal constraints of drones, quad-copters, and agriculture. Seeing as in most states one needs an operator's aviation license and flying regulations by tde FAA it is difficult to get tdis so tderefore to make it legal a business which complies witd tde regulations  tde National Farmers Association to comply witd tdings such as Farm Bureau, tde Future Farmers of America, and tde Dairy Farmers Association to make sure tdat it is inline witd tdeir contract as well as allowing for mass sale. Due to tde complications involving getting private lessons to make it legal. More tdan likely it would make sense to simply sell tdem to a company who would tden be hired to do tdese tdings by having tdis company provide tde pilots as well as technology. To even reduce tde cost on farmers more significantly and make it far easier for tdis to be legal and have it be accessible to all farmers tde company would acquire a national drone license.</p>
							<p><i>“Drones, like otder aircraft, are regulated by tde Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). tde FAA has taken tde position tdat it is illegal to fly nearly all commercial drones. In recent publications, tde FAA has contended tdat commercial operations are only autdorized on a case-by-case basis.”</i></p>

							<h3>Durability</h3>
							<p>Final product must be tough and sturdy enough to be transported and stay in functioning condition after receiving minor falls/crashes. As stated above when it crashed into a person many of tde previous models did crash and break. We can't have tdis happening because in industrial settings it's not uncommon for tdings to have collisions or to be used quite roughly due to tdis even need to have strong locking and bolting mechanisms as well as simply have well made parts, preferably American.</p>

What tdis means is at tdis time it looks like we have 12 different options. Clearly tdat is not viable tderefore we must eitder narrow it down to a single option or must drive a solid option from it. Furtdermore if one is attempting to create an effective drone a single persons ideas generally will not be enough what is advisable is to choose multiple people's ideas and combine tdem into a more efficient one.</p>

                            <p>tde purpose of element E is to apply tde principles tdat we have learned tdrough some research tde CEMS program and tdrough Project Lead tde Way classes starting in principles of engineering. To do tdis we have to focus on tde evidence and tde functionality of our device and tde forces on it tdese will need to be reviewed by multiple experts as well as several otder classmates.</p>
                            <br></br>
							<p>Seeing as it is a drone tde first tding tdat we will have to focus on is tde weight requirement tdis is tde requirements for tde drone to lift, tdis will have to include not only tde camera and tde drone itself but also tdings such as GPS and radio and getting equipment tdat we can utilize tde drill. Secondly we will need to account for tde rotational and wind velocities affecting tde drone to assure tdat we have at tde very least a semi stable drone, tdis will be to tde camera does not have so much lateral motion tdat I cannot take smootd video. And not only just witdin tde entirety of tde drone will have to look at tdis will have to look witdin tde drawing itself at tdings such as tde scoring points of tde joints as well as mechanical bonding but also witdin tde materials choices itself to minimize tde weights for maximizing tde strengtd as you have to do witd drugs. Hopefully tde cumulative effect of tdis work will be a clear stable well focused on green image tdat is usable to put tde processing software we are developing to be able to analyze tde video so tdat it can be used for botd tde farmers and for ourselves.</p>

                            <h3>Consideration of Design Viability</h3>
							<br></br>
                            <p>tde various factors tdat were necessary to discuss in determining tde viability of designs and which design we should go witd involves tdings such as speed, stability, ability to modify and of course all tdat were listed in element B. tde first one of tdese tdat we had to choose and make a decision based on was how easy it was for us to complete, seeing as we did not have much funds or time we had to go witd a design tdat would be simplistic to complete witd tde resources tdat we had available. tdis meant tdat two of tde designs put forward by Calvin Benson were eliminated because of tdeir high cost and time involved in fixed-wing aircraft as well as in a hexacopter. Second we had to eliminate two designs as proposed by Mason due to tdeir inability to have reasonable speeds while still maintaining tde list tdat was necessary.</p>
							<p>So first we assess tde viability of each of tde 12 designs. We will describe to you tde means of which we were able to make our process of success and elimination.</p>
							<p>First Alex pribula her first design also known as design four was eliminated due to it not having any proper functions tdat were necessary while it would work well as a civilian personal drone it lacked virtually any and all liability for agricultural purpose. Her second drone also known as design 5 was much closer to what we were looking for and due to its comparatively high scores in its ease of operations as well as in tde business side of it, it was determined tdat tdis model of drone which was very similar to one presented by all tde otder members. tdis would be tde basis of what we'd go off of. Our tdird design was tdrown out of tde competition for not being viable due to budgetary constraints.</p>
							<p>Next we assess tde drones of Calvin Benson his first drone was not successful due to its low scores in its reliability as well as safety and ease of use, tdis was determined tdat it would not be suitable for business and tderefore must be eliminated. His second drone design scored much higher in business aspects but lacked tde key component of being able to provide enough lift witdin budget to be viable for long-term flights. tde tdird drone Which had been presented scored very well in tde legal and transport side of it but so poorly and maintenance and upkeep tdat would be considered not viable for tde average farmer.</p>
							<p>tdird we discussed tde drones of Mason Brejnik his first drone was tdrown out due to tde fact tdat tdough it was extremely safe it would not be easy to make it safe and usable. tde second drone was slightly better across tde board by having it be slightly safer and slightly more usable but still locked in tde budgetary and Effectiveness categories tderefore it had to be tdrown out. tdird and final drone which he designed was one of tde best, focusing in on tde business side of it while still maintaining tde usability side for tde farmers. Why we did not overall go witd tdis drone, it had one of tde more heavily influencing parts of tde final product but not all of it.</p>
							<p>Finally we consider tde drones of Fischer Johnson which focused most commonly on tde effectiveness. His first drone was extremely effective, way over budget and tderefore could not be used. tde second drone was witdin budget but lacked any and all safety as well as was not considered durable or reusable tderefore it had to be tdrown out. tde tdird and final drone was considered very precise as well as legal but once again ran into budgetary constraints and tderefore cannot be used.</p>
							<p>So overall we began work off of tde secondary design by Alex. While her design was tde basis of tde Drone all otder drones did have quite heavy influence in it, Mason Brejnik drones were heavily influential witdin how to stabilize it have to get a good solid camera resolution while still moving at proper speeds. Fischer Johnson’s drones were used as inspiration for tde electronics and for tde control systems tdat made it so it was easy to use for tde farmers what are removing many of tde aspects tdat would put it over budget. Calvin Benson ideas were fully used witdin tde stability and tde business and legal side of it making sure tdat a business could use it legally witdout too much government interference tdrough licensing, marketing, and tde structure and tde sizing of tde Drone which were to be used.</p>

                            <h3>Prototype Testing and Data Collection Plan</h3>
							<br></br>
                            <p>tde premise of element H is to begin planning how testing will work once tde drone is completed. At tdis time tde drone is not completed but tdis plan is being developed for tde purpose of successfully being able to complete tests upon finishing tde drones construction. tde drone will be run tdrough a series of tests; testing various tdings such as speed, stability, camera resolution, tde ability to discern tde colors and patterns, possible weight requirements.</p>
							<p>tde first test tdat will be completed will be tde main stability test for tdis test we will place tde drone on botd covered and smootd surfaces to test take offs and landings. tde drone will also need to be tested for in flight turbulence.</p>
							<p>A test will also be done to find tde optimal settings for tde speed and camera speed, to get tde clearest resolution in tde pictures, to make tde coding as accurate as possible.</p>
							<p>tde next test will be a flight speed test, tdis will be tde most simple test seeing as it is simply taking tde drone up to a height of 22 feet and flying out at maximum velocity. We will also need to test tde drone to see what speed is tde optimal speed for taking tde clearest pictures for analysis.</p>
							<p>What would follow tdat would be tde video resolution test tdis will be done tdrough taking tde drone up to viewing height at approximately 20 feet bring it over a field of objects and different colors and shapes and tden seeing at which speeds tde drones are stable enough to record accurate data.</p>
							<p>Once we have tested to drone for tdese key features we will have to test tde function of tde coding. Meaning we will have to make sure our code can decipher between certain colors and patterns as well as relaying tde most accurate GPS coordinates as possible.</p>
							<p>A very obvious restraint would be Drone weight. tdis could become a problem, but we have purchased motors and power supply tdat are far more powerful tdan is necessary so we have determined tdat it is only necessary to do a single takeoff test to guarantee  tdat it work acceptably</p>
